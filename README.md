NutriFit AI
Tagline: An AI-powered fitness coach that rewards your health goals using blockchain technology.

What is NutriFit AI?
NutriFit AI is your personal fitness assistant that helps you stay on track with your meals and workouts. It uses machine learning to create personalized plans based on your needs — and here's the twist: when you stick to your goals, you earn HealthTokens as rewards. These tokens are stored on the blockchain, so they’re secure and can’t be faked. It’s fitness with real motivation built in.
